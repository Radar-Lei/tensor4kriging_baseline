# tensor4kriging
## Spatiotemporal graph-embedded low-rank tensor learning for large-scale traffic speed kriging.
## Coming soon!
> This is the code repository for our preprint(manuscript) 'Correlating sparse sensing for network-wide traffic speed estimation: An integrated graph tensor-based kriging approach' submitted to Transportation Research Part C, which is publicly available after publication.


## Datasets
In this repository, we have used two small-size traffic flow datasets to show how to implement our model, they are:  
- **Guangzhou-small**: Speed data with the first 50 locations and the first 15 days. The size is (144 × 50 × 15).

We provide the two datasets in [../Datasets/](https://github.com/tongnie/tensorlib/tree/main/Datasets).
The original links for the complete data are given as following.
