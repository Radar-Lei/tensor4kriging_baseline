# tensor4kriging
## Spatiotemporal graph-embedded low-rank tensor learning for large-scale traffic speed kriging.
This is the code repository for our preprint(manuscript) 'Correlating sparse sensing for network-wide traffic speed estimation: An integrated
graph tensor-based kriging approach' submitted to Transportation Research Part C, which is publicly available after publication.
