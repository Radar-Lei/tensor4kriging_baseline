## To be completed
> This is the code repository for our preprint(manuscript) 'Correlating sparse sensing for network-wide traffic speed estimation: An integrated graph tensor-based kriging approach' submitted to Transportation Research Part C, which is publicly available after publication.


## Datasets
We adopt the large-scale PeMS-4W data to demonstrate how to implement LETC model to perform kriging with missing data imputation.
- **PeMS-4W**: Large-scale traffic speed data measured by 11160 static sensors from the [performance measurement system](https://pems.dot.ca.gov/) in California. The first four weeks of loop speed data with a 5-min window is pre-processed and available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/3939793).
