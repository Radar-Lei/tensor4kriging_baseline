We provide the large-scale PeMS speed datasets (nearly 90 million observations) to demonstrate the usage of LETC model.

PeMS-4W data set

This data set contains freeway traffic speed collected from 11160 traffic measurement sensors over 4 weeks (the first 4 weeks in the year of 2018) with a 5-min time resolution (288 time intervals per day) in California, USA. It can be arranged in a matrix of size 11160 x 8064 or a tensor of size 11160 x 288 x 28 according to the spatial and temporal dimensions. Note that this data set contains about 90 million observations.
